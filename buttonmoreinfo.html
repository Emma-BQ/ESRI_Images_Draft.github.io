      2017: MELCC conducted a study to examine the connectivity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of the St. Lawrence Lowlands based on the connectivity conservation framework presented by Albert et al. (2017). In this study, terrestrial connectivity was assessed using 5 focal species (hyperlink “species”) that are representative of all species in the St. Lawrence Lowlands and their respective habitat and connectivity requirements in the forested habitats of the St. Lawrence Lowlands (Albert et al. 2016, Meurant et al. 2018).
      3 Phases:
        Phase 1 : Preliminary Analysis to assess the quality and connectivity of forest habitat patches for the five focal species in the Lowlands based on 2016 land cover (Rayfield et al. 2018).
        Phase 2: Based on current land cover, this phase focused on the identification of forest patches and landscape linkages for forest patches and landscape linkages for biodiversity conservation in the Lowlands based on their contribution to the quality and connectivity of forest habitats for all five species (Rayfield et al. 2019).
        Phase 3 : This story’s focus, which is on simulating different scenarios of land use and land cover (LULC) and climate change (hyperlink) in the Lowlands to assess their effect on the future habitat quality and connectivity for the 5 species, showing stark contrasts between current and future conditions, especially regarding the worst case scenario. In turn, this helps inform government entities and organizations about the set of conservation priorities that are needed in the St. Lawrence Lowlands to minimize the risk of habitat quality and connectivity loss under projected LULC and climate changes. The section on connectivity (hyperlink) dives deeper into the LULC and climate scenarios, habitat suitability, habitat connectivity, and conservation priorities.
